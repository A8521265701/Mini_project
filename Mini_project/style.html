                There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An
                adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new
                things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “The
                risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”
                <br><br>
                Adventure fills in thrill in our lives. There are many ways to indulge in adventure. Different people
                like
                different adventurous activities. Some of these ways are mentioned below:

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                I have come to love bicycles in the course of the past year. I am especially fond of mountain bikes,
                including my own. Riding it opens up a whole new world of opportunities and challenges for me. I am
                still fairly fresh to the whole mountain biking scene, so I push myself to become better with more
                experience. Riding is an outlet; it is something I can channel pent up energy through. I love the sport
                because it is a full body, soul, and mind experience that affects all five of the senses.
                <br><br>
                Moutain biking is amazing, because it will take you through some crazy fast adventures and you can
                witness nature perfectly.I love riding my bike in the mountains and i will tell you what i think and
                feel when i go riding. First i would like to talk about the mountains, they are a work of art that is
                meant for people to ride on. About two days ago i went on a 15 mile bike ride at 3 in the morning, sure
                it was still dark but i had a blast, i mounted a high batterie flashlight on

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
                harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by
                the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br><br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
                kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.
                By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a
                few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
                surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also
                be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in
                wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on
                their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a
                wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
